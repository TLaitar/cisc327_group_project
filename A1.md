All documentation for the different section is stored in the testcases directory, under their respective `[section].md`, authorial credit is given in the header of each markdown file.
It is our understanding that these tests will be front facing API tests, run through the seleniumBase Chrome API which controls a Chromium browser. These automated tests are performed everytime we push a new commit to the main branch through the GitHub actions.
When we actually have written our code test cases, each section will occupy its own directory in a testcase parent directory, this allows us to consolidate our codebases, and avoid mixing tests with production code.

In terms of issues our group has reported problems with the constrains in R4, specifically that R4.2 does not specify a minimum length for ticket names; empty fields would make the entire name system very hard to work with. Additionally, we have reported a potential constraint problem relating to posting expired tickets, namely that there is no constraint to prevent new expired invisible tickets from filling our database; a longterm stability problem/vector for exploits. These issues were reported and appended to the ongoing test issues.
