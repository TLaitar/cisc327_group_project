These tests will be front-end API tests, implemented through the selenium API (backed by a chromium browser). These automated tests are performed everytime a new commit is pushed to the repository through GitHub actions. These tests can also be run locally by calling `pytest`.

In the implementation stage, our test code will be centralized in a testing directory, where each set of tests will exist in distinct sub-directories. In this way we hope to maintain a clean code-base where testing/development code can easily be removed in production. Additionally this approach should more easily modify and organize our tests, and eliminate problems more easily.


At this stage of the project, our team discovered some constraint problems in section R4. Specifically, we found that R4.2 fails to specify a minimum length for ticket names allowing for empty fields to be entered. We also discovered that there was no constraint to prevent the listing of expired tickets. Both of these problems are hugely problematic for the long term stability of this system, and open us up to security vulnerabilities (in the case of the former) and potential fraudulent sales (in the case of the latter).
Both of these issues have been reported to the client, and definitions to alieve these problems have been put in place. We will of course, report and address more potential vulnerabilities/problems as they are discovered.
